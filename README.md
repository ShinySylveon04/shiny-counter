# Let's Go Shiny Counter

This is a simple project I made using React to display the shiny odds while shiny hunting in the Let's Go games.

The shiny odds were taken from serebii, which were the datamined values found in the games from SciresM.

Pokemon images/gifs are from https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/sprites/.

A special thank you to @zaksabeast for helping me whenever I needed it :)
